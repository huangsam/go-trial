# Go Trial

[![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/huangsam/go-trial/ci.yml)](https://github.com/huangsam/go-trial/actions)

Curated learning designed for Software Engineers proficient in [Python] / [Java] / [C++]
and need to quickly ramp up their Go skills for work.

> The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.

There's no better time to master Golang than now! ðŸ”¥

## Getting started

Here are the commands you need to know:

```shell
# Setup tools
./setup.sh

# Run build
./build.sh

# Run tests
./test.sh
```

### Documentation

To see the documentation via CLI:

```shell
# Show docs for package
go doc github.com/huangsam/go-trial/pkg/basicintro

# Show docs for package entity
go doc github.com/huangsam/go-trial/pkg/basicintro.Person
```

To see the documentation via web server:

```shell
# Run godoc server
godoc -http :8080
```

Then open up a browser on <http://localhost:8080>.

### Generate mocks

To generate mocks for testing, add interfaces to `.mockery.yaml`.

Then run the following commands:

```shell
# Run mockery to generate mocks
mockery
```

## Goals

Here is a checklist of things I want to cover:

- [x] [Intro to functions, structs](pkg/basicintro/)
- [x] [Data structures](pkg/datastructure/)
- [x] [Goroutines, channels, sync primitives](pkg/concurrency/)
- [x] [Interfaces, generics, mocking](pkg/abstraction/)
- [x] [Real world integrations](pkg/realworld/)
