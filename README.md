# Go Trial

Time to master certain things for Golang.

## Getting started

Here are the commands you need to know:

```shell
# Run build
./build.sh

# Run formatting
./format.sh

# Run tests
./test.sh

# Run benchmarks
./test.sh bench
```

## Goals

Here is a checklist of things I want to cover:

- [x] Intro to functions, structs
- [x] Data structures
- [ ] Goroutines
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Synchronization primitives
- [ ] Interfaces
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Standard library (file I/O and date/time)
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Mocking if possible
- [ ] HTTP and GRPC
