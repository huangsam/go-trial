# Go Trial

Time to master certain things for Golang.

Here is a checklist of things I want to cover:

- [ ] Data structures
- [ ] Goroutines
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Synchronization primitives
- [ ] Interfaces
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Standard library (file I/O and date/time)
- [ ] Generics
- [ ] Mocking if possible
- [ ] HTTP and GRPC
