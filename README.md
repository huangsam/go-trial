# Go Trial

There's no better time to master Golang than now! ðŸ”¥

Previous trials include: [Python], [Java], [C++]

## Getting started

Here are the commands you need to know:

```shell
# Run build
./build.sh

# Run tests
./test.sh
```

### Documentation

To see the documentation via CLI:

```shell
# Show docs for package
go doc io.huangsam/trial/pkg/basicintro

# Show docs for package entity
go doc io.huangsam/trial/pkg/basicintro.Person
```

To see the documentation via web server:

```shell
# Install godoc
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc@latest

# Run godoc server
godoc -http :8080
```

Then open up a browser on <http://localhost:8080>.

## Goals

Here is a checklist of things I want to cover:

- [x] [Intro to functions, structs](pkg/basicintro/)
- [x] [Data structures](pkg/datastructure/)
- [x] [Goroutines, channels, sync primitives](pkg/concurrency/)
- [x] [Interfaces, generics, mocking](pkg/abstraction/)
